Hello, this is the github account for Jeremy Chong.

I've recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and am eager to get into the work force. I've recently gotten the IBM data analyst certification, as well as the Microsoft Azure AZ-900 certification.

Iâ€™m currently reviewing and polishing my skills in popular languages like Java and Javascript. 

You can reach me at jjc4bz@gmail.com.
