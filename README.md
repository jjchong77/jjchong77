Hello, this is the github account for Jeremy Chong.

I'm currently studying AI and ML at Seneca Polytechnic, and am eager to put those skills to use as I get into the field. I've also obtained an IBM data analyst certification,the Microsoft Azure AZ-900 certification, and have also completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 

You can reach me at jjc4bz@gmail.com, or jchong37@myseneca.ca.
